Yeem Contact Form is a simple contact form plugin with very easy to use form builder.  

== Description ==

This is a very straightforward contact form which comes with the basic elements that we need in our "Contact Us" page.  The form builder interface is unbelievably easy to use!  It is as simple as CLICK IT, LABEL IT, SAVE IT!
The form elements can also be rearranged by drag-and-drop.

It supports the following fields:
    *   Text
    *   Email
    *   Date (Calendar pop-up)
    *   Comment/Message Box
    *   Drop Down Selection
    *   Checkboxes
    *   Radio Buttons
    
This is perfect for those who only need a NAME, EMAIL, MESSAGE kind of contact form as well as those who require a lengthy and detailed form for bookings!

There is also a separate Settings page where you can provide your email address, the confirmation message to your customer, as well as the acknowledgement to your customer after sending the form.

Currently, it only supports the use of a shortcode [yeem_contact_form] which you can include in your post or page. Only one (1) form is supported.
